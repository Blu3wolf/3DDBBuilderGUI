# 3DDBBuilderGUI
A WIP GUI for F4-3DDBBuilder

## Overview
3DDBBuilderGUI will be a small, graphic interface wrapper for F4-3DDBBuilder. Using the F4_3DDBBuilder.exe CLI has never been easier!

F4-3DDBBuilder is coded by Mike Rivers and updated by Dunc and Switch of the BMS Dev Team. You can download it here: http://gofile.me/2lc3U/2p8CO3wnX 

You can read more about it here: https://www.bmsforum.org/forum/showthread.php?32203-BMS-Tool-F4-3D-Database-Builder 

A copy is also included with each Release of 3DDBuilderGUI. 

3DDBBuilderGUI is presently ARR, but is considering a variety of FOSS licenses depending on compatibility with the licensing of the source tool. If the GNU GPL v3 is not available due to compatibility, the lGPL is a primary alternative under consideration.
